Remove character
Send Feedback
For a given a string(str) and a character X, write a function to remove all the occurrences of X from the given string.
The input string will remain unchanged if the given character(X) doesn't exist in the input string.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.

The second line of input contains a character(X) without any leading and trailing spaces.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string. 
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second






void removeAllOccurrencesOfChar(char input[], char c) {
    // Write your code here
 int j, n = strlen(input);
    for (int i = j = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (input[i] != c)
            input[j++] = input[i];
 
    input[j] = '\0';  
}
